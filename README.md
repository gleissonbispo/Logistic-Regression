In statistics, the logistic model (or logit model) is a widely used statistical model that uses a 
logistic function to model a binary dependent variable, although many more complex extensions exist. 

Mathematically, a binary logistic model has a dependent variable with two possible values, 
such as pass/fail, win/lose, alive/dead or healthy/sick; these are represented by an indicator variable, where the 
two values are labeled "0" and "1".
